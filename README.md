# Project Overview

Cloud File Storage System is a cloud-based web application that enables users to securely upload, manage, and share files using Amazon S3. The application uses Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication and is deployed on Render for public access.

The project demonstrates cloud storage integration, secure authentication, and cloud deployment in a practical environment.

---

# Problem Statement

# Project Workflow

## User Authentication

1. User opens the application.
2. User clicks Login with Google.
3. Google verifies the user.
4. User is redirected to the dashboard.

## File Upload

1. User selects a file.
2. Flask receives the file.
3. File is uploaded to AWS S3.
4. Dashboard is updated.

## File Download

1. User clicks Download.
2. Flask generates a pre-signed URL.
3. File is downloaded securely.

## File Sharing

1. User clicks Share.
2. A temporary shareable link is generated.
3. User can share the file.

## File Deletion

1. User clicks Delete.
2. File is removed from AWS S3.
3. Dashboard refreshes automatically.
